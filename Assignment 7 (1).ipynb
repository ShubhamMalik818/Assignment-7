    "\n",
    "1. Data Preparation: This step involves collecting and preprocessing the data for model training. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, data \n",
    "                     normalization, feature engineering, and handling missing values. The data is typically split into two subsets: the training set \n",
    "                     and the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Selection: In this step, you choose the appropriate model or algorithm for your problem based on the type of data, the problem domain, and \n",

    "                    for achieving good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Training: In this step, the selected model is trained on the training dataset. The model learns the patterns and relationships in the data \n",
